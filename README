make to compile

In the scripts directory, you will find some sample scripts.

N.B. installing the xboard GUI is not so easy in 2019 as it was in 2005 :-)

For CentOS 7, I needed to download the source code from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/xboard-4.9.1.tar.gz
Then, I need to install:
- texinfo
- cairo-devel
- pango-devel
- librsvg2-devel
- gtk2-devel
in order to run smoothly:
- ./configure
- make
- make install
